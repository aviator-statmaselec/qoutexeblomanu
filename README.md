## What is a Bonus Code or Promo Code in Quotex?

A bonus code, also known as a promo code in Quotex is a special word,
character, or a mix of letters, numbers, and characters that you can use
in the promo area in a Quotex deposit process to get extra money for
FREE.

If you have access to any promo code, you must use them to: --

-   Increase your trading capital
-   Get free extra cash for trading money

Plus, Quotex promo codes and bonuses are not limited to a maximum of 50%
extra cash; you can sometimes get bonuses as high as 100%.

## Other bonuses to take advantage of in Quotex

-   **Risk-free trades:** this is a special kind of bonus offered to
    active traders to use in their daily trading. As the name suggests,
    Quotex risk-free trades are trades that remove all the risks from
    trading.
-   **Cashback:** This kind of bonus is more or less the same as the
    risk-free trades bonus but with a twist. Unlike risk-free trades
    that give you back all your lost money, cashback allows you to only
    receive a percentage of your trading volume back.
-   **Cancel X points:** This is a tool used on Quotex to cancel a
    losing trade. If you use this tool you will salvage your money if
    your trade is losing.
-   **Percentage of turnover:** This promo bonus allows you to get a
    percentage of your trading volume back when you trade.
